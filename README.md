# 👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineer | PhD Student

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I’m a 4th-year **PhD student** in Electrical Engineering at **Lund University**, Sweden, focusing on **trustworthy and robust machine learning**.

## 🔬 About Me

I’m currently pursuing my PhD at Lund University, where my research centers on **reliable decision-making** in machine learning, emphasizing **robustness**, **fairness**, and **privacy**. 

In fall 2024, I had the opportunity to be a guest PhD student at **EPFL** in Switzerland, exploring task arithmetic in **multi-task learning** with **vision-language models**.

My academic background includes an M.Sc. in Medical Engineering and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering.
